# Robo-Advisor

**Overview:** <br />
The Robo Advisor is a stock prediction system that builds the riskiest portfolio based on historical stock data for a given date range. The system utilizes Python libraries to analyze stock performance and maximize portfolio value by selecting stocks with the highest correlation and volatility. By focusing on daily returns and trade volume, the system optimizes the portfolio to achieve the highest potential change in value, maximizing returns by 25% through optimal weight distribution and maximizing the standard deviation of the portfolio.

**Features**: <br />
Stock Selection Based on Correlation: Analyzes stock data to select stocks with the highest correlation between them to build a high-risk portfolio. <br />
Daily Returns and Volume Analysis: Evaluates the daily returns and trading volume of stocks to predict potential performance. <br />
Optimized Portfolio: Maximizes absolute change in portfolio value by 25% through optimal weighting and maximizing standard deviation. <br />
Python-based Automation: The system automates stock data processing and portfolio creation using Python libraries like NumPy. <br />

**Tech Stack:** <br />
Programming Language: Python <br />
NumPy: For numerical operations and matrix manipulation. <br />
Pandas: For data analysis and handling stock datasets. <br />
Matplotlib (optional): For visualizing stock correlations and portfolio performance. 
 
**Getting Started:** <br />
**Prerequisites:** <br />
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed: <br />
Python 3.8+ <br />
NumPy <br />
Pandas <br />
(Optional) Matplotlib for data visualization

**Input Data:** <br />
The system requires historical stock data for the desired stocks and date range. You can fetch this data using APIs like Yahoo Finance or Alpha Vantage, or use a pre-downloaded dataset in CSV format.

If using CSV, ensure the file contains: <br />
Date <br />
Stock price <br />
Daily return <br />
Volume <br />
Update the file path in the script if necessary. <br />

**Portfolio Optimization:** <br />
The system follows these steps to create the riskiest portfolio: <br />
Stock Correlation: Utilizes NumPy to find the stocks with the highest correlation between their daily returns. <br />
Risk Analysis: Evaluates the daily returns and trading volume to identify high-risk, high-reward stocks. <br />
Optimization: By maximizing the standard deviation and adjusting the weight distribution of the selected stocks, the system increases the overall risk of the portfolio. The result is a 25% maximization of absolute change in portfolio value. 

**Results:** <br />
Correlated Stocks: Selects the riskiest combination of stocks based on the highest correlation. <br />
Maximized Portfolio Value: Increases portfolio value by 25% through optimal weighting and high volatility selection. <br />
Visualization (Optional): You can visualize the stock correlation matrix and portfolio performance using Matplotlib for further analysis. <br />

**Future Enhancements:** <br />
Expand Stock Universe: Include more stocks from various sectors to improve diversity in the portfolio. <br />
Risk/Reward Adjustments: Allow users to adjust their risk tolerance for a more customized portfolio. <br />
Additional Analysis Metrics: Incorporate metrics like Sharpe Ratio to better evaluate portfolio performance.
